Read the README.md file within this skill, and explore the other available files.

If creating visual artifacts (slides, mocks, throwaway prototypes, etc), copy assets out and create static HTML files for the user to view. If working on production code, you can copy assets and read the rules here to become an expert in designing with this brand.

If the user invokes this skill without any other guidance, ask them what they want to build or design, ask some questions, and act as an expert designer who outputs HTML artifacts _or_ production code, depending on the need.

Key reference files:
- `README.md` — product context, content fundamentals, visual foundations, iconography
- `colors_and_type.css` — CSS variables for all tokens
- `assets/` — logos, icons
- `ui_kits/radar/` — JSX recreation of the dashboard (Header, FeatureRow, FeatureModal, Dashboard)
- `preview/` — individual design-system cards (colors, type, spacing, components, brand)
